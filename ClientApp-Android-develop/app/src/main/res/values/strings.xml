    <string name="wbt_learn_more_data">Research shows that taking the time to stop and check-in with yourself is a powerful and important life skill. It has many mental, physical, emotional and spiritual benefits. Checking-in is an act of mindfulness that increases self-awareness. \n\n

When you take the time to ask yourself important questions about aspects of your life, you gain a better understanding of your current emotions, strengths, weaknesses, resilience and driving factors. \n\n

With this gained self-awareness, you become empowered with insight about what parts of your life are keeping you strong and what areas you need to take action for positive change.\n\n

Scientists have also discovered that the simple act of practising mindfulness helps improve your overall health and wellbeing. Mindfulness can help improve mental health, relieve the physical impact of stress, treat heart disease, lower blood pressure, reduce chronic pain, improve sleep, and alleviate gastrointestinal difficulties.</string>
